# Task Scheduler

## Overview

Task Scheduler is a web application that allows users to create, manage, and organize tasks. Users can add tasks with descriptions and due dates, and categorize them into different columns such as "Urgent", "In Progress", "Complete", and "Backlog". The application also supports drag-and-drop functionality for easy task management.

## Features

- Create tasks with a title, description, and due date using DOM manipulation.
- Edit and delete tasks.
- Drag and drop tasks between different columns using DataTransfer Objects.
- Filter and sort tasks based on different criteria.
- Store tasks as JSON objects in the current session. 
- Store tasks in a MySQL database using a Node.js server. (Persistent storage not ready)
- Responsive design with a clean and intuitive user interface.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Javascript, and extra features in Node.js, Express
- Database: MySQL (extra)
- Styling: CSS Flexbox
